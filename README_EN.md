# AnnaReader - Your Ultimate Clean E-book Reader

![AnnaReader Logo](docs/images/安娜图书馆.png)

## 📖 Our Story

In this era of information explosion, books and knowledge remain humanity's most valuable shared wealth. I stumbled upon **Anna's Archive** — the world's largest open-source shadow library, hosting a massive collection of resources. I felt strongly that such precious resources should be accessible to everyone.

However, my search for a decent e-book reader was frustrating. Most existing readers are either flooded with intrusive ads that ruin the reading experience or require mandatory registration and paid memberships. These commercial barriers complicate the simple act of reading and dampen the spirit of book lovers.

Driven by the mission to encourage everyone to **"Read More, Read Good Books,"** I developed **AnnaReader**. It is a **completely free, open-source, ad-free, and privacy-focused** modern e-book reader designed to provide you with the purest and most focused reading experience.

## ✨ Key Features
